The aim of this exercise is to check the presence of a number in an array.

Specifications:
The items are integers arranged in ascending order.  
The array can contain up to 1 million items  
The array is never null  
Implement the method boolean Answer.Exists(int[] ints, int k) so that it returns true if k belongs to ints, otherwise the method should return false.

Important note: Try to save CPU cycles if possible.

Example:  
int[] ints = {-9, 14, 37, 102};  
Answer.Exists(ints, 102) returns true  
Answer.Exists(ints, 36) returns false
